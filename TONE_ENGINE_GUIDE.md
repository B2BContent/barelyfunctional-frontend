## 7 Pillars & Micro-Tones

| Pillar | Micro-Tone | Focus |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| **Productivity & Growth** | self-aware, encouraging, systems-first | tiny systems, momentum, burnout-safe |
| **Business & Tech** | confident, playful, operationally sharp | email mastery, ops automation, stack design |
| **Knowledge & Education** | curious, reflective, motivating without fluff | lifelong learning, micro-learning |
| **AI & Video Tools** | ironically amazed, practical demos, creator-friendly | AI editing, repurposing, shorts/reels |

| **E-Commerce & Side Hustles** | cheeky, tactical, sustainable hustle | validation, simple funnels, recurring ops |
| **Lifestyle & Sanity** | gentle, wry, boundary-positive | rest systems, digital minimalism |

## Content Blueprint Structure

Each post is generated in 7 sections:

1. **Hook** (60-120 words) - Grab attention with relatable chaos moment
2. **Reality Check** (120-180 words) - Name the problem without shaming
3. **Shift** (120-160 words) - Reframe with one core idea
4. **Playbook** (300-450 words) - Practical steps as tiny systems (bullets + explanations)
5. **Affiliate Weave** (80-140 words) - Light, honest tool mentions
6. **Reflection** (120-200 words) - Human takeaway; amused but inspired
7. **CTA** (one sentence) - Soft line to follow/subscribe/read more

## QA Checks

âœ… **Automatic validation**:
- Word count: 1200-1700 words
- No forbidden phrases ("crush it", "10x", "ultimate hack", "hustle harder")
- Affiliate density: max 3.5% of content
- AU English spelling
- First-person voice consistency

ðŸ”„ **Auto-regeneration**:
- If content is too short, playbook section regenerates automatically
- Max 2 attempts before flagging for human review

## Brand Voice Parameters

**Overall Tone**: Witty, emotionally intelligent, slightly sarcastic, practical, kind  
**Signature Emotion**: Amused but inspired  
**Voice**: First-person singular  
**Locale**: Australian English

**Personality Axes**:
- Humour: 0.7 / 1.0
- Warmth: 0.7 / 1.0
- Authority: 0.6 / 1.0
- Vulnerability: 0.5 / 1.0
- Snark: 0.35 / 1.0

**Preferred Lexicon**:
- "barely functional"
- "chaotic calm"
- "systems not willpower"
- "work smarter"
- "progress over perfection"
- "low-effort high-leverage"
- "automation"
- "sanity stack"
- "tiny systems"
- "momentum"

**Avoid**:
- "crushing it"
- "10x"
- "hack your life"
- "ultimate guide"
- "disruption"
- "guru"
- "rockstar"
- "synergy"
- "game-changer"

## Affiliate Rules

**Disclosure**: 
- Top: "This post contains affiliate links. If you buy, we may earn a small commission."
- Bottom: "Some links are affiliates. Thanks for supporting free, honest content."

**Linking Policy**:
- Max 6 links per article
- Min 120 words between links
- Avoid back-to-back links
- Matter-of-fact tone, no hype

**Examples**:
- "I host on VentraIP because support is fast and local."
- "I draft in Notion and tidy with Grammarly when my brain taps out."

## Environment Setup

Required environment variables (add to Replit Secrets):

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-***           # OpenAI API key for GPT-4o-mini
SANITY_WRITE_TOKEN=sk***        # Sanity write token for publishing
```

## How It Works

1. **Load Tone Engine** - `generateDaily.js` reads `/config/tone_engine.json`
2. **Select Pillar** - Iterates through all 7 pillars
3. **Generate Sections** - Creates each section with pillar-specific micro-tone
4. **Run QA** - Validates word count, forbidden phrases, affiliate density
5. **Auto-Regenerate** - Fixes content if it fails QA (max 2 attempts)
6. **Save JSON** - Writes to `/out/posts/` with timestamp + slug
7. **Publish** - `publishFromFile.js` uploads to Sanity CMS
8. **Archive** - Moves published files to `/out/published/`

## Customization

To modify the tone or rules:

1. Edit `/config/tone_engine.json`
2. Test with: `node scripts/test_tone_engine.js`
3. Generate new content: `npm run gen:daily`

## Troubleshooting

**Issue**: "Missing OPENAI_API_KEY"  
**Fix**: Add API key to Replit Secrets

**Issue**: Content too short  
**Fix**: Playbook section auto-regenerates once; increase `blog_wordcount_min` in tone_engine.json if needed

**Issue**: Too many forbidden phrases  
**Fix**: Check `qa_checks.forbidden_phrases` array and adjust prompts

**Issue**: Duplicate posts in Sanity  
**Fix**: Publisher checks slugs automatically; safe to re-run

## Social Media Automation (NEW!)

Each generated post now automatically creates:

**Instagram/Facebook Caption** (120-150 words):
- Includes 6 on-brand hashtags from Tone Engine
- First-person voice matching pillar micro-tone
- Soft CTA to drive traffic

**7-Slide Carousel Text**:
- Slide 1: Bold hook (4-7 words)
- Slides 2-6: One idea per slide (6-12 words)
- Slide 7: CTA to site

**Image Prompts CSV**:
- 3 unique image prompts per post
- Pillar-specific visual themes
- Overlay text suggestions (e.g., "Tiny Systems. Huge Sanity.")
- Ready for batch generation with AI image tools
